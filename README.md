# twitchbot
Has one command, as an example. This bot has no features, it is intended to show one of many methods of connecting to the Twitch Messaging Interface (TMI), which is an IRC-like system, with PHP. Take it and modify it as you wish, though I would appreciate a quick message if you find it useful.

Enjoy!
